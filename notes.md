# 🧠 Programming Logic – Notes

---

## 🔹 Algorithm

📌 **What is it?**  
➡️ A sequence of logical and ordered steps to solve a problem.

🎯 **Purpose**  
➡️ Define how a problem will be solved before writing code.

🧪 **Simple example**  
➡️ A recipe: follow step by step to reach a result.

💡 **Why it matters**  
➡️ Every program is based on one or more algorithms.

## 🔹 Flowchart

📌 **What is it?**  
➡️ A visual representation of an algorithm.

🎯 **Purpose**  
➡️ Make the logic easier to understand before coding.

🕒 **When to use**  
➡️ Planning a solution  
➡️ Understanding complex logic  
➡️ Explaining a process clearly  

🧩 **Main symbols**
- 🟢 **Oval** → Start / End  
- 🟦 **Rectangle** → Process  
- 🔷 **Diamond** → Decision (Yes / No)  
- ➡️ **Arrow** → Flow direction

## 🔗 Algorithm × Flowchart

| Algorithm | Flowchart |
|---------|----------|
| Text-based | Visual |
| Step-by-step description | Diagram |
| Focus on logic | Focus on understanding |

➡️ Both aim to solve the same problem.
