# 🧠 Programming Logic – Notes

---

## 🔹 Algorithm

📌 **What is it?**  
➡️ A sequence of logical and ordered steps to solve a problem.

🎯 **Purpose**  
➡️ Define how a problem will be solved before writing code.

🧪 **Simple example**  
➡️ A recipe: follow step by step to reach a result.

💡 **Why it matters**  
➡️ Every program is based on one or more algorithms.

## 🔹 Flowchart

📌 **What is it?**  
➡️ A visual representation of an algorithm.

🎯 **Purpose**  
➡️ Make the logic easier to understand before coding.

🕒 **When to use**  
➡️ Planning a solution  
➡️ Understanding complex logic  
➡️ Explaining a process clearly  

🧩 **Main symbols**
- 🟢 **Oval** → Start / End  
- 🟦 **Rectangle** → Process  
- 🔷 **Diamond** → Decision (Yes / No)  
- ➡️ **Arrow** → Flow direction

## 🔗 Algorithm × Flowchart

| Algorithm | Flowchart |
|---------|----------|
| Text-based | Visual |
| Step-by-step description | Diagram |
| Focus on logic | Focus on understanding |

➡️ Both aim to solve the same problem.

# 📘 Programming Logic — Input, Process & Output

This repository contains my study notes from a Programming Logic bootcamp.
Here I document the fundamental concepts that form the base of all programming.

---

## 🔹 Input
**Input** is any data that the program receives from the user or from another source.

### Examples of input:
- Numbers typed by the user  
- Text (name, password, commands)  
- Mouse clicks or keyboard actions  

**Example:**
User types their age → INPUT


---

## 🔹 Process
**Process** is what the program does with the input.  
It includes logic, calculations, and decision-making.

### Examples of processing:
- Mathematical calculations  
- Comparing values  
- Conditional logic (if / else)

**Example:**
Age × 12 → PROCESS


---

## 🔹 Output
**Output** is the result produced by the program after processing the input.

### Examples of output:
- Text displayed on the screen  
- Messages  
- Calculated results  

**Example:**
"You are 240 months old" → OUTPUT


---

## 🔁 Input → Process → Output (IPO Model)

The IPO model represents the basic structure of any program:

INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT


### Real-life example:
☕ Coffee Machine  
- **Input:** Press a button  
- **Process:** Heat water and brew coffee  
- **Output:** Coffee ☕  

---

## 🔷 Simple Algorithm Example
INPUT: user enters two numbers
PROCESS: add the numbers
OUTPUT: display the result

## ⭐ Features
**Features** are the functionalities or capabilities of a system or application.
They describe *what the program can do*.

### Examples of features:
- User login system  
- Character movement in a game  
- Score counter  
- Menu navigation  

---

### Features in games 🎮
In game development, features represent player interactions and game mechanics.

**Examples:**
- Player movement  
- Attack system  
- Inventory system  
- Save/load progress  

---

### Simple feature example
Feature: Character Jump
Input: Player presses the jump key
Process: Apply jump force to the character
Output: Character jumps on the screen


---

### Why features are important
- Help organize development  
- Make planning easier  
- Allow breaking a project into smaller parts  
- Improve communication inside a team
## 🧠 Why this matters
- Every program follows this structure  
- Games constantly use the IPO model:
  - **Input:** player presses a key  
  - **Process:** game logic runs  
  - **Output:** character moves on screen 🎮
